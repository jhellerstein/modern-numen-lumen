# modern-numen-lumen
This is an attempt to recreate the University of Wisconsin-Madison modern Numen Lumen logo in a clean vector file.

Original png was cropped from the cover page image of [this dissertation](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/47840?fbclid=IwAR22Uu6ygqKpzvILC7y8AlCVoRqDltz4Y4wgx_0hKlknBeszbtKyk30i-rY), loaded into Adobe Illustrator, and converted via Image Trace and recoloring to the UW-approved #c5050c. The text in the wordmark file was re-typeset using the Helvetica font, which seems to match the original font well but may not be perfect.
