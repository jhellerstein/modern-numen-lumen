# modern-numen-lumen
This is an attempt to recreate the University of Wisconsin-Madison modern Numen Lumen logo in clean vector file.

Original png was cropped from the cover page image of [this dissertation](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/47840?fbclid=IwAR22Uu6ygqKpzvILC7y8AlCVoRqDltz4Y4wgx_0hKlknBeszbtKyk30i-rY).

Included here are Adobe Illustrator files as well as generated output in svg and png formats. The Illustrator wordmark file uses the Helvetica font, which seems to match the original font well but may not be perfect.
